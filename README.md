# emailslicer.py

This Python script allows you to slice and extract the username, domain, and extension from an email address. Simply input your email address, and the script will provide you with the relevant information.
How to Use

    Run the script, and it will prompt you with "Welcome to the email slicer" and an empty line.

    Enter your email address when prompted: input your email address:

    The script will then process your input and extract the username, domain, and extension from the email.

    The output will be displayed as follows:

    makefile

    Username: <username>
    Domain: <domain>
    Extension: <extension>

    The script will continue to run in an infinite loop, allowing you to input multiple email addresses one after the other. To exit the loop and stop the script, use the appropriate termination command for your operating system (e.g., Ctrl+C on most systems).
